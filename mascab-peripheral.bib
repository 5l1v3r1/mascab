    This paper is peripheral at best, in the sense it details a cache design
    intended to prevent buffer overflow attacks; the idea is quite involved,
    but basically uses the cache as a redundant, hardware-backed stack which
    can detect manipulation of return addresses.  The peripheral connection 
    to cache-based attacks stems from the inclusion of a mechanism for cache
    line locking: each line can be controlled st. eviction is prevented.

    one can configure it to capture a subset of signals for some period, and
    then export the result for analysis.  In a sense, this yields a problem 
    of the same style as scan-chain based attacks, namely a tension between
    the needs of observability and security.

    Dynamic Frequency and Voltage Scaling (DVFS) is a mechanism to manage the
    energy consumption of, for example, processor cores; the idea is the core
    voltage level and/or clock frequency can be dynamically controlled, which
    allows them to be reduced during periods of relative inactivy in order to
    reduce energy consumption.  

    On ARM-based platforms using Android, DVFS is managed by the kernel.  The
    paper shows that {\em if} a malicious kernel driver can gain control over 
    DVFS, this abilility can be leverage to drive the core beyond the stated
    operational limits; the result is fault(s) during execution, which can be
    capitalised upon per traditional fault attacks (e.g., based on clock or
    power glitching: in essence, this is a software-defined fault vs. a fault
    injected by physical means).
